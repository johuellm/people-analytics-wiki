          <p>
            Despite people analytics being a hype topic and attracting attention from both academia and practice, we found only few academic studies on the topic, with practitioners driving discussions and the development of the field. To better understand people analytics and the role of information technology, we performed a thorough evaluation of the available software tools. We monitored social media to identify and analyze the 41 people analytics tools listed here.
